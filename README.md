# MongoDB Driver Resource Leak

This repository demonstrates a potential resource leak in the MongoDB driver when using async/await.  Improper handling of the client's `close()` method can lead to exhausted connection pools and subsequent errors. 

The `bug.js` file illustrates the issue, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected implementation.

## Bug Description

The original code doesn't reliably close the MongoDB connection, potentially leading to connection pool exhaustion. This occurs because the `client.close()` method is asynchronous, and its completion isn't explicitly awaited in all scenarios.

## Solution

The solution uses a more robust error-handling mechanism to ensure that `client.close()` is always called, even if an error occurs during database operations. This prevents resource leaks and ensures reliable database interaction.
